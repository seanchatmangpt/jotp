 * Wire Tap — EIP system-management pattern that inserts a point-to-point channel into a message
 * flow to inspect or copy messages without affecting the main channel.
 *
 * <p>The tap consumer receives every message asynchronously on a dedicated virtual thread so it
 * cannot slow down or block the primary message flow. The primary channel always receives the
 * original message, regardless of tap failures.
 *
 * <p>Use cases: audit logging, debugging, monitoring, message tracing, protocol bridging.
 *
 * <p>Erlang/OTP analogy: tracing via {@code sys:trace/2} — attaches a handler that receives copies
 * of messages without interfering with the traced process.
 *
 * <p>Composition: a WireTap wraps any {@link MessageChannel}, so multiple taps can be stacked:
 * {@code new WireTap<>(new WireTap<>(primary, tap1), tap2)}.
 *
 * @param <T> message type
